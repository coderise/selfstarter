        <h5>Where your contributions will go</h5>
        <p><strong>Travel costs</strong> for inspirational tech entrepreneurs and programmers to visit us.</p>
        <p><strong>Meals and transportation</strong> for participants - keeping it accessible to everyone.</p>
        <p><strong>Program costs</strong> including material for daily courses and visits to&nbsp;local tech initiatives - anything from Barcamps and DemoDays to Meetups in Medellin.</p>
        <p><strong>Program Evaluation&nbsp;</strong>to make sure we evaluate what works and what doesn't, in order to continue improving.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>More about what Coderise will do</h5>
        <p>We have a hunch that by creating a space where kids gain the tools and connections necessary to launch into the field of programming web applications, in the long run -- kids are going to be inspired to use their creativity for anything from creating great products, to solving local community issues through technology to taking charge of their destiny.</p>
        <p>In terms of tools, we mean the basic concepts any good programmer needs to create great web applications:  HTML, some CSS and Javascript and some Ruby.  In addition, we're going to get them acquainted with Github, Heroku, how to search for code  on the web -- all key tools for getting the job done.  How basic these concepts are over others is arguable.  What we REALLY want to teach is HOW to learn.</p>
        <p>In terms of connections, we mean the necessay exchange of past experiences from people already out there launching a startup that is filling a global social need.  To empower youth that likely don't know much about the programming and tech start up scene, to meet people like @AndresBarreto from Onswipe,  Alex Torrenegra (@Torrenegra) and our other tech entrepreneurs is essential to accompany tools with a vision. </p>
        <p>We plan to do all of this in two months in EAFIT, the top university in Medellin, three times a week, covering transport and food for all participants and speakers that come all the way out to Medell√≠n for the program.</p>
