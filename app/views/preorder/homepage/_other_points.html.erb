      <h3>More about what Coderise will do</h3>
      <p>We have a hunch that by creating a space where kids gain the tools and connections necessary to launch into the field of programming web applications, in the long run -- kids are going to be inspired to use their creativity for anything from creating great products, to solving local community issues through technology to taking charge of their destiny.</p>
    </li>
    <li id="section-2">
      <p>In terms of tools, we mean the basic concepts any good programmer needs to create great web applications:  HTML, some CSS and Javascript and some Ruby.  In addition, we're going to get them acquainted with Github, Heroku, how to search for code  on the web -- all key tools for getting the job done.  How basic these concepts are over others is arguable.  What we REALLY want to teach is HOW to learn.</p>

    <li id="section-3">
      <p>In terms of connections, we mean the necessay exchange of past experiences from people already out there launching a startup that is filling a global social need.  To empower youth that likely don't know much about the programming and tech start up scene, to meet people like @AndresBarreto from Onswipe,  Alex Torrenegra (@Torrenegra) and our other tech entrepreneurs is essential to accompany tools with a vision.</p>

    <li id="section-4">
      <p>We plan to do all of this in two months in EAFIT, the top university in Medellin, three times a week, covering transport and food for all participants and speakers that come all the way out to Medell√≠n for the program.</p>
